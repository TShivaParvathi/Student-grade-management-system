# Student-grade-management-system
A simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage student grades efficiently. It allows users to add, store, view, and search student records using the browser's local storage — no backend required.

B: 80–89

C: 70–79

D: 60–69

F: Below 60

✅ Display in Table Format

All student records are displayed in a responsive HTML table.

✅ Prevent Duplicate Entries

Duplicate student names are not allowed (case-insensitive).

✅ Local Storage Integration

All data is saved in the browser's local storage and persists across sessions.

✅ Search Functionality

Search for students by name using a dynamic search bar.

✅ Load & Clear Data

📥 Load Students: Fetches saved records from local storage.

🗑️ Clear All Records: Deletes all data from the browser after confirmation.
